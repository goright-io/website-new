          This workshop helps you learn and practice design systems working in a
          team. You can join as a designer or developer.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The designers define visual design language and Figma components. At
          the same time, the developers create the components with React. You
          practice iterative component-driven design and development and create
          documentation along with making the product. The exercise contains
          managing collaborative updates and keeping the code in sync with the
          design reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the workshop, each team has a ready-to-use component
          library, an end product built out of that, and a tuned process to
          ensure smooth updates.
